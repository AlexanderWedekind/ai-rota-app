# ai-rota-app



## To build this on local machine:

(this should come without a .env, so you'll need your own OpenAI API-key)

1. open terminal in root directory
2. in terminal do `cd ai-rota-app`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run build`
5. `cd ../backend-ai-rota-app`
6. `npm install`
7. `npm run start-backend`

It should say:
backend is up and running and frontend served at http://localhost:8000
