In this updated CSV string, each employee has a non-zero value in only one field for each of the 'mon-shifts' to 'sun-shifts' columns. Only one field in each 'shift' column has a non-zero value, and all other fields stay at 0. The 'hall1-shift' fields have either 0 or 8 as numeric values, while the 'hall2-shift' and 'hall3-shift' fields have either 0 or 2 as numeric values.

index-0abc936c.js:47 To complete the rota according to the instructions, you would need to update each field in the csv string accordingly. For example, to assign an employee to work on Monday morning in Hall 1, you would update the field in the "mon-hall1-am" column and the corresponding field in the row for that employee with the value 8. You would also need to ensure that all other fields in the "mon-hall1-am" column and all other "mon-shifts" columns for that employee are set to 0. You would repeat this process for each employee and for each day and hall shift. Once all fields have been updated according to the instructions, the rota would be complete.

index-0abc936c.js:47 To update the rota according to these instructions, the following steps can be taken:

1. Parse the csv string into a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing one employee's information. The keys of each dictionary should be the column names, and the values should be the corresponding values for that employee.

2. Iterate over each employee in the list, and for each employee, iterate over each shift column. For each shift column, set all fields to 0 except for one field which should be non-zero. This ensures that each shift column has at least one employee assigned.

3. Iterate over each shift column, and for each shift column, iterate over each employee. For each employee, set all fields under the corresponding day's shifts (e.g. all fields under 'mon-shifts' for Monday) to 0 except for one field which should be non-zero. This ensures that each employee is assigned to only one shift per day.

4. For the 'hall1-shifts', set all fields to either 0 or 8.

5. For the 'hall2-shifts' and 'hall3-shifts', set all fields to either 0 or 2.

6. Convert the list of dictionaries back to a csv string.

Here's some sample code to implement these steps:
